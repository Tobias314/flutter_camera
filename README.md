# Flutter Camera

**Attention: This is a fork of the original flutter packages repo but limited only to the flutter_camera plugin for some experimental modifications.**

This repo is a companion repo to the main [flutter repo](
https://github.com/flutter/flutter). It contains the source code for Flutter's
first-party packages (i.e., packages developed by the core Flutter team).
Check the [`packages`](./packages) directory to see all packages.

These packages are also available on [pub](https://pub.dev/flutter/packages).
